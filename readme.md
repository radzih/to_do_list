# Todo List API

The **Todo List API** is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage their tasks. The API is built using clean architecture principles and SOLID design principles, ensuring that the code is maintainable, scalable, and testable.

The API is written in Python and uses several technologies to operate, including:

 - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database system used to store user and task data.
 - **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python that is designed to be fast, easy to use, and high-performance.
 - **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server that runs FastAPI applications with high performance and low resource usage.
 - **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and ORM for Python that provides a set of high-level API for connecting to databases and executing SQL statements.
 - **Alembic**: A database migration tool for SQLAlchemy that makes it easy to manage changes to database schema over time.

The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks for each user. Tasks can be organized and filtered based on various criteria such as due date, completion status, and user ID. The API also supports the creation of new users, allowing for the creation of multiple user accounts and the associated tasks.

This API can be used by developers to create their own Todo List applications that allow users to manage their tasks easily and efficiently. The use of clean architecture and SOLID principles ensures that the code is modular and easy to maintain, allowing for the addition of new features or modifications to the existing functionality with ease.

Overall, the Todo List API provides a powerful tool for developers who want to build flexible and scalable applications that enable users to manage their tasks effectively.
